# Hera for Move Everything

Juno-60 emulation synthesizer module based on [Hera](https://github.com/jpcima/Hera) by Jean Pierre Cimalando (jpcima).

Analog-modeled polyphonic synthesizer with DCO, resonant VCF, BBD chorus, and LFO — faithful to the Roland Juno-60 architecture.

## Features

- 6-voice polyphonic (balanced for Move's ARM CPU)
- Faust-generated DSP: DCO, VCF, VCA, HPF, and chorus
- BBD (bucket-brigade device) chorus simulation with Chorus I / II modes
- Resonant lowpass filter with envelope, LFO, and key tracking modulation
- Full ADSR envelope with gate mode option
- 56 factory presets
- Works standalone or as a sound generator in Signal Chain patches

## Prerequisites

- [Move Everything](https://github.com/charlesvestal/move-everything) installed on your Ableton Move
- SSH access enabled: http://move.local/development/ssh

## Install

### Via Module Store (Recommended)

1. Launch Move Everything on your Move
2. Select **Module Store** from the main menu
3. Navigate to **Sound Generators** > **Hera**
4. Select **Install**

### Build from Source

Requires Docker (recommended) or ARM64 cross-compiler.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charlesvestal/move-everything-hera
cd move-anything-hera
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

## Controls

| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Jog wheel | Browse presets |
| Knobs 1-8 | Adjust parameters for current category |

In Shadow UI / Signal Chain, parameters are organized into navigable categories.

## Parameters (26 total)

### DCO (Oscillator)
`saw_level`, `pulse_level`, `sub_level`, `noise_level`, `pwm_depth`, `pwm_mod` (LFO/Manual/Env), `pitch_range`, `pitch_mod`

### VCF (Filter)
`vcf_cutoff`, `vcf_resonance`, `vcf_env`, `vcf_lfo`, `vcf_key`, `vcf_bend`

### VCA (Amplifier)
`vca_depth`, `vca_type` (Envelope/Gate)

### Envelope
`attack`, `decay`, `sustain`, `release`

### LFO
`lfo_rate`, `lfo_delay`, `lfo_trigger` (free/key trigger)

### HPF
`hpf`

### Chorus
`chorus_i` (on/off), `chorus_ii` (on/off)

## Troubleshooting

**No sound:**
- Check that a preset is loaded (preset name shows in display)
- Ensure `saw_level` or `pulse_level` is above 0
- Try a different preset — some may have very specific settings

**Thin or dull sound:**
- Increase `vcf_cutoff` — filter may be closing off harmonics
- Enable Chorus I or II for stereo width and warmth

**CPU usage high:**
- Play fewer simultaneous notes
- Chorus adds BBD simulation overhead — disable if not needed
